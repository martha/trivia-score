# Trivia Scoring Algorithms

## Usage

Run with python 3.12.1

### Ranked Lists

This algorithm is for scoring trivia participants' ranked lists of items.
In the example file, `vitamin_c_example.py`, participants are ranking
fruits and vegetables based on how much vitamin C they contain.

Create your own new python file, copying from `vitamin_c_example.py`.
It should contain an answers hash where items are mapped to their correct
values, and for each participant it should contain a ranked list of items.

Import the answers and the participant guess lists in `ranked_list_score.py`
and then modify this line of the `main` function at the bottom:
```
score(example_guess, vitamin_c_mg_per_100g, p, q)
```
Copy and paste it for each guess you have.

Run the script:

```bash
python ranked_lists/ranked_list_score.py
```

It will output to the console like this:
```
